# Week 17 - Flask for Backend

## Objective
The objective of this challenge is to build a simple RESTful API using Flask to manage tasks. This exercise will help students reinforce their understanding of API development, HTTP methods, and JSON responses.

## Challenge Overview
Students will develop a Task Management API that supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The API should be able to:
- Create a new task
- Retrieve all tasks
- Retrieve a task by ID
- Update a task
- Delete a task
- (Bonus) Mark a task as completed

## Instructions
### 1. Setup
- Install Flask if not already installed:  
  ```bash
  pip install flask
  ```
- Create a Python script (`app.py`) for the API.

### 2. API Requirements
Implement the following endpoints:

#### **Create a Task**
- **Endpoint:** `POST /tasks`
- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "title": "Task Title",
    "description": "Task Description"
  }
  ```
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Task Title",
    "description": "Task Description",
    "completed": false
  }
  ```

#### **Retrieve All Tasks**
- **Endpoint:** `GET /tasks`
- **Response:**
  ```json
  [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Learn Flask",
      "description": "Build an API using Flask.",
      "completed": false
    }
  ]
  ```

#### **Retrieve a Specific Task**
- **Endpoint:** `GET /tasks/<task_id>`
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Learn Flask",
    "description": "Build an API using Flask.",
    "completed": false
  }
  ```

#### **Update a Task**
- **Endpoint:** `PUT /tasks/<task_id>`
- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "title": "Updated Task Title",
    "description": "Updated Task Description"
  }
  ```
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Task updated successfully."
  }
  ```

#### **Delete a Task**
- **Endpoint:** `DELETE /tasks/<task_id>`
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Task deleted successfully."
  }
  ```

#### **(Bonus) Mark a Task as Completed**
- **Endpoint:** `PATCH /tasks/<task_id>/complete`
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Task marked as completed."
  }
  ```

## Evaluation Criteria
- Correct implementation of API endpoints.
- Proper use of HTTP methods and status codes.
- Clear and structured code with proper documentation.
- Effective teamwork and problem-solving approach.

This challenge encourages students to apply their Flask knowledge while working collaboratively to design a functional API. 🚀
